This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v10.0.3 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL)!

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a `netlify.toml` for deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Installation options

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/unfoldingword-box3/greek-apparatus-app.git`
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm run dev`
3. Make your changes
4. Connect to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL) manually (the `netlify.toml` file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)
